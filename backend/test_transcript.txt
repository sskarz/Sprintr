Interviewer: Thanks for chatting with us. Any feedback on using me.com?

User: Yeah, I really wish there was a dark mode toggle on the site. I use it a lot at night and the bright white screen is rough on my eyes. A simple dark mode option would make it way more comfortable to use.

Interviewer: Got it, appreciate that. Anything else?

User: That's really it. Just a dark mode so my eyes can rest while I'm using the site. Every other app I use has one.

Interviewer: Thanks for the feedback!
