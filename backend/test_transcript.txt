Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to chat with us today. Let's start with your general impression of the website's look and feel.

User: Honestly, the first thing that hits me every time I open the site is all the green. Everything is green — the buttons, the navigation bar, the links, the icons. It feels like I'm looking at a spreadsheet from the '90s. It's really off-putting.

Interviewer: Interesting. Can you tell me more about what specifically bothers you about the green?

User: It just doesn't feel professional. I work in finance, and every other tool I use — Slack, Bloomberg, our internal dashboards — they all use blues and grays. When I pull up your site in a meeting to show something to a client, the bright green buttons make it look like a toy. I've actually had a colleague ask me if it was a beta or something. It's embarrassing.

Interviewer: That's really helpful context. Are there specific UI elements where the green is most problematic?

User: The primary action buttons are the worst offender. The big green "Submit" and "Confirm" buttons clash with everything else on the screen. And the navigation bar being that same green is just overwhelming. I'd expect something like a calm blue or a navy for the nav bar. Blue conveys trust and professionalism — green just screams "go" like a traffic light.

Interviewer: Got it. What about the hover states and active indicators?

User: Those are actually even worse. When I hover over a menu item, it goes from green to an even brighter green. There's zero contrast. Half the time I can't even tell what I'm hovering over. If those were blue — like a nice hover-to-darker-blue transition — it would be so much more readable. I've actually misclicked on things because I couldn't tell which element was active.

Interviewer: Has this affected your workflow at all?

User: Definitely. I avoid using the site when I'm screen-sharing because of how it looks. I also find myself squinting at the sidebar because the green active-state indicator blends in with the green background of the menu. If the active tab were highlighted in blue against a neutral background, I could scan the navigation way faster. Right now I waste time just figuring out which section I'm in.

Interviewer: Are there any parts of the current design that you do like?

User: The layout itself is fine. The spacing, the typography, the card-based design — all good. It's literally just the color scheme that ruins it. If you swapped all the greens for blues and kept everything else the same, it would be a completely different experience. I'd actually feel good showing it to people.

Interviewer: Any other thoughts on the visual design?

User: One more thing — the success and error states are confusing because everything is already green. When I submit a form and get a green success banner, it doesn't stand out at all because the whole page is green. I almost missed a confirmation once because the success message blended right into the header. If the base UI were blue, then green for success and red for error would actually work and be immediately noticeable.

Interviewer: That's a great point about the feedback states. Really appreciate the detailed feedback — this is exactly what we needed to hear.
